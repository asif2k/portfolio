// gator_dog: in soma's one form of a creature file (soma/creature_file.js): `body` is the creature as it was made, the rest is who it is to the others (family, nav, abilities) and its mind: the blocks of soma/world/blocks/ it loads by name and
// its tree (an animal's own clips: the clip set `quad/dog`). The old worker of this file is left out; the mind below is the default of a creature of its kind (animal): write the creature's own in `mind`.
// gator_dog: a creature MADE OF THE PARTS CATALOGUE'S PIECES (mixed, alligator dog): built by soma/tools/piece_creatures.js from its recipe soma/creator/saved/gator_dog.creator.json (the recipe is the source of truth:
// `node soma/tools/piece_creatures.js regenerate gator_dog` makes this file again after a piece of the catalogue is built again). The creator studio opens it for modification: /soma/soma_creator_studio_demo.jh?creator=/soma/creatures/gator_dog.js
