// gun_jeep (soma/tools/gun_jeep.js makes this file from jeep.js): the JEEP below, with a machine gun on a pintle over the rear tub and a mind that drives up to the nearest hostile creature and shoots it. The jeep's own story: an open four wheel car for two with a DOOR on each side. In soma's one form of a creature file (soma/creature_file.js): the body is the creature as it was made, the mind is the blocks of soma/world/blocks/ it loads and its tree.
// jeep: 3.9 m long, 1.7 m wide, an open tub, a folded windscreen frame and a roll bar. ONE JS FILE IS ONE CREATURE: it is read as text, run with new Function("api", text) and RETURNS the creature { name, family, nav, body, abilities, interaction, mind }.
// Metres, +x to its left, +y up, +z forward, the wheels on y = 0 (a wheel is a bone whose HEAD is the hub). A VEHICLE of the car model: the front wheels steer, all four drive; 12 m/s.
// SEATS AND DOORS (soma/js/seat_api.js, SOMA.md "Seats and doors"): two seats (the driver on the left, the passenger on the right), each with the pedals under its feet, the wheel under the driver's hands, and a door that it gets in by.
// A DOOR is a bone hinged at its FRONT edge (its head is the hinge, it runs back along the door: the hinge turns across it): the left one opens with a negative angle about up, the right one with a positive. A rider stands behind the
// open door, at the `at` of the door, and sits at once (the sitting down is not animated). Its hips are the `at` of the seat: 0.14 over the cushion.
