// PILOT from the wish (`sp.set_intent` a velocity, `sp.set_climb` a climb: the take-off roll with full power, the rotation at 1.15 stall speeds, a bank toward the heading, a landing and the brakes) or with a STICK (`sp.set_controls`: throttle,
// brake, steer, handbrake, pitch, roll, yaw, flaps). The wings and the tail are rigid (fixed joints); the control surfaces are hinges across the chord with the range of a real surface that the aircraft turns by the stick (the rig's limit stop
// holds each one to it: a rudder asked for 60 degrees is at 30); the three wheels are posed by the vehicle: they spin with the ground speed, the nose wheel steers, the suspension follows the ground.
